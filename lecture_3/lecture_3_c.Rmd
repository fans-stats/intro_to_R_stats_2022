# Functions and pipe operators

Functions in R can be difficult to read. For example.



Tidyverse packages introduced a novel approach to nest function:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



# Filtering data

First we load a dataset in a similar way we did last time:

```{r}
urlfile <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv' #this loads a csv file called TutorialData and puts it into urlfile

data <- read.csv(urlfile) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```




# Merging data (and filter)

First we need to create two datasets 



And we can merge those:



# Summarising data and descriptives



We need to use factors in this case.



# The functions group_by() and summarise()





# The function mutate()
