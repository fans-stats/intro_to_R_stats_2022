```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```


1. Load the following dataset:

```{r}
urlfile <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv' #this loads a csv file called TutorialData and puts it into urlfile

data <- read.csv(urlfile) %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble()
data
```

2. We hypothesise that age and GABA levels predict sensory scores, verify that hypothesis.Write the model equation. Explain what each variable represents.

```{r}
data %>% 
  lm(formula = Sensory1 ~ GABA) %>% 
  summary()
```


3. Verify whether the residuals of the model are normally distributed.


```{r}
data %>% 
  lm(formula = Sensory1 ~ GABA) %>% 
  broom::augment() %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = .std.resid)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + 
    theme_bw()
```


4. Obtain the 95% CI for your model betas.

```{r}
data %>% 
  lm(formula = Sensory1 ~ GABA) %>% 
  confint()
```


5. Estimated the R squared for your model.

```{r}
data %>% 
  lm(formula = Sensory1 ~ GABA) %>% 
  summary()
```
