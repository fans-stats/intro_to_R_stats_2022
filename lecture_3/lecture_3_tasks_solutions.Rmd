```


1. Create a vector and perform a few operations using pipe (%>%).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(42)
x <- sample(-101:255,100)

x %>% 
  abs() %>% 
  mean()
```


- For the dataset available in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv.

2.  Filter for female-only participants and obtain descriptive statistics for GABA and Sensory1 variables.

```{r}
readr::read_csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv') %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Sex == 'F') %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mean_GABA = mean(GABA), 
                   mean_Sensory1 = mean(Sensory1))
```


3. Obtain mean and standard deviation for Age, GABA and Sensory1 in each Group using summarise().

```{r}
readr::read_csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv') %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mean_Age = mean(Age), 
                   sd_Age = sd(Age), 
                   mean_GABA = mean(GABA), 
                   sd_GABA = sd(GABA), 
                   mean_Sensory1 = mean(Sensory1), 
                   sd_Sensory1 = sd(Sensory1))
```


4. From the output of the previous outputs, obtain the 95% CI using mutate().

```{r}
readr::read_csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv') %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(n = length(Age), 
                   mean_Age = mean(Age), 
                   sd_Age = sd(Age), 
                   mean_GABA = mean(GABA), 
                   sd_GABA = sd(GABA), 
                   mean_Sensory1 = mean(Sensory1), 
                   sd_Sensory1 = sd(Sensory1)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(Age_lCI = mean_Age - 1.96 * (sd_Age/n), 
                Age_uCI = mean_Age + 1.96 * (sd_Age/n), 
                GABA_lCI = mean_GABA - 1.96 * (sd_GABA/n), 
                GABA_uCI = mean_GABA + 1.96 * (sd_GABA/n), 
                Sensory1_lCI = mean_Sensory1 - 1.96 * (sd_Sensory1/n), 
                Sensory1_uCI = mean_Sensory1 + 1.96 * (sd_Sensory1/n))
```
