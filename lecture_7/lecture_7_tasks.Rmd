```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load the following dataset:

```{r}
urlfile <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeJasonL/BIG-TAC/main/TutorialData.csv' #this loads a csv file called TutorialData and puts it into urlfile

```

2. We hypothesise that age and GABA levels predict sensory scores, verify that hypothesis.Write the model equation. Explain what each variable represents.

3. Verify whether the residuals of the model are normally distributed.

4. Obtain the 95% CI for your model betas.

5. Estimated the R squared for your model.
